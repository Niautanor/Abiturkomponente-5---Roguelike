The First actual Readme for a project, that I will actually release.

I may include something like a MAKEFILE later on so you can compile it more easyly but at time it isn't that important to me.

To Install it:
1. download the Release/Abiturkomponente(...).exe
2. extract the contents of the 'Lib' Directory in the same Directory you moved the .exe
3. copy the 'Font' Directory in the Directory(The whole Font not just its contents)
4. Now you should be able to see what I did in my spare time

It may be, that you need aditional Libraries to run it on your OS. If you would tell me, which Librarys it demands I can see if I can distribute them in the Lib directory

And btw:
All Code-Comments are in German because it is afterall still a school project. sorry for that.
