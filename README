The First actual Readme for a project, that I will actually release.

I may include something like a MAKEFILE later on so you can compile it more easyly but at time it isn't that important for me.

To Install it download the Release/Abiturkomponente(...).exe
and the 'Lib' as well as the 'Font' Directory.

and extract the 'Lib' Directory to the .exe and copy the 'Font' Dir in the same Directory(the Directory should still be named 'Font')

It may be, that you need aditional Libraries to run it on your OS. If you would tell me, which Librarys it demands I can see if I can distribute them in the Lib directory

And btw:
All Code-Comments are in German because it is afterall still a school project. sorry for that.
