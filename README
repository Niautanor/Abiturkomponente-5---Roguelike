The First actual Readme for a project, that I will actually release.

And I am still learning to work with vim(therefor this line).

I may include something like a Makefile later on so you can compile it more easyly but at time it isn't that important to me.

To build the project from source:
Prerequisites:
	Librarys: Freetype2, SDL_ttf, SDL and SDLmain (development versions)
	Includes: the coresponding headers(you might have to make them somehow accessible to your compiler(If that is the case: I have no Idea))

use g++ with "-iquote ../include" from the Source Directory

It may be, that you need additional Libraries to run it on your OS. If you would tell me, which Librarys it demands I can see if I can distribute them in the Lib directory

And btw:
All Code-Comments are in German because it is after all still a school project. sorry for that.
